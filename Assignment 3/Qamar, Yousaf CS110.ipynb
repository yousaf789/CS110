This would allow us to separate the classes which would basically mean that instead of just having one class where every method that involves using the entire structure as a whole would be defined alongside the node structure itself instead of separately. By separating them, it will be easier for us identify the parts of the code that are supposed to use the entire structure as a whole while also handling the specific parts in the form of node which will have their own atributes. This will help us a lot when it comes to debugging, as the classes are separated while also making additions to the code, for future improvement in funmctionality, much easier, by separting the node class and that class specficially having its attributes we can easily add more attributes."

    "> - If you are coding two classes, your Trie class should, upon initiation, create the root Node. If you are coding a single class, use an attribute to mark the root node.\n",
    "> - Finally, ensure that the trie can be initiated with a wordbank as an input. This means that a user can create a trie and feed it an initial set of words at the same time (like in the tests below), which will be automatically inserted into the trie upon its creation. Likely, this will mean that your `__init__()` has to make some calls to your `insert()` method.\n",
    "> - Several test cases have been provided for your convenience, and these include some, but not all, possible edge cases. If the implementation is correct, your code will pass all the tests. Note: there are several ways in which we can condense the text cleaning syntax that we have provided for you without repeating the method `replace()` multiple times. However, we are leaving it this way for clarity.\n",

    "The number of times this function has to be called is dependent on the lenght of the word that we are given. If we take the length of a word as n, we see that this becomes a complexity of O(n). We can see that the time complexity of inbuit functions like lower() will work in consatnt time so it takes O(1). The making aof new nodes and changing of the nodes takes constant time so it can be written as O(1). \n",

    "T(n) = O(n) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(n) + 3O(1)\n",

    "As the lookup() method is a case sensitive implementation of the insert method with no addition or removal of loops that might affect the complexity, the overall time complexity of both these method wil be the same. However, we need to consider the fact that their spacer complexity might differ as lookup method does not add anything to the existing Trie structure. On the other hand an insert method does add to Trie structure. This would mean that the the possible space complexity of lookup method wil be O(1) whereas we need to store n letter in thew insert method the complexity will be O(n).\n",

    "\n",
    "For Trie trees the runtime is dependent on the length of the word that is being inputted, as it is a k-array search tree, while for BST it is dependent on the height of the tree as we have to compare across the height in order to carry out insert or lookup method. Thus for BST the methods are dependent on O(h), where h is the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at both Trie trees and BST in practical terms, we can see that the trie will mostly take more time, as it can possibly have more than two children, unlike BST, the number of children will simply be bound by the number of valid characters. Having more children would mean that each level we will have to compare across more than two values, unlike BST, with the possibility of comparing across all the characters at each level. Even without the possibility of having a maximum, there is a high probability that having more than two children would make Trie tress worse than BST. However, if we look at the specific implementation of words and literature, we would not be able to achieve the same level of functionality with a BST as it would not be able to all the amount of data required, so Tri trees will be preffered in these cases."

    "### Q3‚ÄîFind the $k$ most common words in a speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mathematically determine the overall connotation of a speech, you might want to compute which words are most frequently used and then run a sentiment analysis. To this end, add a method to your code, `k_most_common()` that will take as an input $k$, an integer, and return a list of the $k$ most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you‚Äôre confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "> - To complete this exercise, you don‚Äôt have to bother with resolving ties (for example, if $k = 1$, but there are two most common words with the same frequency, you can return either of them). You can consider resolving ties as an extra challenge and let us know if you believe you solved it.\n",
    "> - The test cell below downloads and preprocesses several real-world speeches, and then runs the k-most-common word analysis of them; your code should pass the tests. There are cleaner and more concise ways to write that testing code, but this way should be easily understandable. The tests contain the following speeches:\n",
    ">> - Mehreen Faruqi - Black Lives Matter in Australia: https://bit.ly/CS110-Faruqi\n",
    ">> - John F. Kennedy - The decision to go to the Moon: https://bit.ly/CS110-Kennedy\n",
    ">> - Martin Luther King Jr. - I have a dream: https://bit.ly/CS110-King\n",
    ">> - Greta Thunberg - UN Climate Summit message: https://bit.ly/CS110-Thunberg\n",
    ">> - Vaclav Havel - Address to US Congress after the fall of Soviet Union: https://bit.ly/CS110-Havel\n",
    "> - As usual, add at least **three** more tests, and **justify** why they are relevant to your code (feel free to find more speeches to start analysing too!).\n",
    "> - Again, copy-paste your previous code and adjust to this *new version*. Note that the method is indented on purpose.\n",
    "> - This task will probably require your nodes to store more information about the frequency of words inserted into the tree. One data structure that might be very useful to tackle the problem of traversing the tree and finding the most common words is heaps‚Äîyou **are** allowed to use the `heapq` library or another alternative for this task."

    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a new `autocomplete()` method for your class, which will take a string as an input, and return another string as an output. If the string is not present in the tree, the output will be the same as the input. However, if the string is present in the trie tree, your task is to find the most common word to which it is a prefix and return that word instead (this can still turn out to be itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "> - To make the task more interesting, use the test cell code to download and parse *The Complete Works of William Shakespeare*, and insert them into a trie. Your autocomplete should then pass the tests below. This is a *large* book, so the code might take a while to run...!\n",
    ">- As usual, add at least **three** more test cases, and explain why they are appropriate (you can use input other than Shakespeare for them).\n",
    "> - Make sure to include a minimum **100 word-summary critically evaluating** your autocomplete engine. How does it really work? Your critical reflection needs to precisely assess the role of the different data structures used by their algorithm and what is the overall complexity that the algorithm offers. Can we do better? If so, how and by how much?\n",
    "> - Again, depending on how you choose to implement it, your `autocomplete()` might make calls to other helper methods. However, make sure that `autocomplete()` is the method exposed to the user in order to pass the tests.)*\n",
    ">- *Note*: this is a manifestly frequentist approach to the problem, which is not the only method to solve this computational problem, and in many cases, not the ideal technique. However, if you were tasked with implementing something like [this](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) or [this](https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/autocomplete/), it might just be enough, so let‚Äôs give it a go. Good luck!*"
